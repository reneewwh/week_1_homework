Stripe, was found by Patrick Collison and John Collison in San Francisco California, US. 

## From Thought to Reality: Unveiling the Genesis of an Idea
Patrick Collison and John Collison, the co-founders of Stripe, are brothers and had a close relationship growing up. They both attended the same school in Ireland and shared an interest in technology and entrepreneurship from a young age. 

The concept of Stripe originated from their personal encounters with managing an online business which John found the most challenging aspect revolved around facilitating customer payments - crafting a **dependable and secure payment system** of this nature was an inherently demanding endeavour.

During that era, the available online payment methods were laden with numerous steps, incurred multiple fees, and demanded weeks for setup – a route the Collison brothers were uninterested in taking. Instead, they composed a mere seven lines of straightforward code that **enterprises could integrate into their websites and apps, instantly establishing connections with credit card and banking systems** for *seamless* payment reception, hence significantly streamlining the process.

In 2010, both siblings left college and started Stripe which was initially named */Dev/Payments*, as an online payment processing platform. Eventually, the company's vision encompassed serving web-based businesses of all scales, curbing fraud, and delivering user-friendly payment remedies.
